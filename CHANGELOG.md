  - `make_ymaze_track()` - Create Y-maze tracks with configurable angles
  - `make_track_from_points()` - Create tracks from manual point specification
  - `make_track_from_image_interactive()` - Interactive track builder from images (Jupyter-compatible)
  - `_build_track_from_state()` - Helper for retrieving interactive builder results in Jupyter

- **Validation & QC Module** (`validation.py`):
  - `check_track_graph_validity()` - Validate track graph structure and attributes
  - `get_projection_confidence()` - Calculate confidence scores for position projections
  - `detect_linearization_outliers()` - Detect outliers using projection distance and jump detection
  - `validate_linearization()` - Comprehensive quality assessment with scoring and recommendations

- **Tutorial Notebooks**:
  - `track_linearization_tutorial.ipynb` - Comprehensive pedagogical tutorial for basic usage
  - `advanced_features_tutorial.ipynb` - Tutorial covering track builders, validation, and interactive features

- **Core Functionality**:
  - `project_1d_to_2d()` - Reverse mapping from 1D linear positions back to 2D coordinates
  - Numba-optimized Viterbi algorithm for HMM inference (when numba available)
  - Exposed `project_1d_to_2d` in package `__init__.py`

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Pre-commit hooks configuration for automated code quality checks
  - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with quality, test, build, and publish jobs
  - Support for Python 3.13
  - PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC) support for secure releases
  - Automated GitHub release creation with changelog extraction
  - Notebook execution testing in CI
  - Modern dependency pinning with lower bounds following Scientific Python SPEC 0
  - Enhanced ruff configuration with numpy-specific and pandas-vet rules
  - Improved mypy configuration with test-specific overrides
  - pandas-stubs for better type checking
  - Comprehensive test suite for track builders and validation (117 tests total)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Dropped support for Python 3.9 (minimum version now 3.10)
- Upgraded minimum dependency versions:
  - numpy >= 1.24 (was unpinned)
  - scipy >= 1.10 (was unpinned)
  - matplotlib >= 3.7 (was unpinned)
  - pandas >= 2.0 (was unpinned)
  - dask[array] >= 2023.5.0 (was unpinned, added array extra)
  - networkx >= 3.2.1 (explicit minimum for compatibility)
- Replaced deprecated pandas `.values` with `.to_numpy()` in utils module
- Updated CI workflow to test Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
- Replaced old test_package_build.yml with modern release.yml workflow
- Fixed non-breaking hyphen character in error message
- Enhanced `__init__.py` with comprehensive module docstring
- Improved README with new features section and tutorial links
- Interactive track builder uses two-step workflow in Jupyter (non-blocking)
- Outlier detection uses robust statistics (median + MAD) instead of mean + std

### Fixed
- Unused `fig` variables in plotting functions (now use `_` prefix)
- Import sorting and organization per ruff standards
- Regex pattern in pytest match statement (now uses raw string)
- Dict literal style issues in track_builders.py (using `{}` instead of `dict()`)
- Outlier detection false positives on uniform data
- Interactive builder event loop blocking in Jupyter notebooks

### Infrastructure
- New GitHub Actions workflow structure:
  - Separate quality, test, build, and publish jobs
  - Parallel testing across Python versions
  - Artifact management for distributions
  - Integration with Codecov for coverage reporting
